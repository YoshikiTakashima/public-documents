* Hi!
  I am a PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at
  Carnegie Mellon University. My co-advisers are Prof. [[http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/liminjia/][Limin Jia]] and
  Prof. [[https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/pcorina/][Corina Pasareanu]].

  My research helps developers build more robust software by
  leveraging automated, language-aware solutions for testing and
  verification. Current work includes automatic testing and
  verification of libraries written in Rust
